# GIT FLOW:
            Branch that we will push changes: master branch
- write your codes
- do commits
- after last commit
- update your own feature branch (	“fetch” - update and merge master into local own branch)
- then you push from your local branch to your origin(remote) branch
- On GIT create a pull request(base:master, compare:yourBranch) from your origin branch to master branch
- then assign your assignee(communicate to them(send a discord message))

# important
- do not push to and from "master" branch
- do not touch the utilities (stays as it is)
- try not to checkout to master branch
